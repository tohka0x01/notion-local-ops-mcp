# notion-local-ops-mcp

[中文说明](./README.zh-CN.md)

Turn a Notion **MCP Agent** into a local coding agent for local files, shell, git, and delegated tasks.

![MCP Agent working in a local repo](./assets/notion/notion-handoff-chat.png)

## What This Project Does

- exposes local files, shell, git, and patch-style editing through MCP
- lets an MCP Agent work on a real local repo instead of only editing Notion pages
- supports delegated long-running tasks through local `codex` or `claude`

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/notion-local-ops-mcp.git
cd notion-local-ops-mcp
cp .env.example .env
./scripts/dev-tunnel.sh
```

Set at least:

```bash
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_WORKSPACE_ROOT="/absolute/path/to/workspace"
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_AUTH_TOKEN="replace-me"
```

## Important MCP Agent Configuration

Use this in your MCP Agent configuration inside Notion:

- URL: `https://<your-domain-or-tunnel>/mcp`
- Auth type: `Bearer`
- Token: `NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_AUTH_TOKEN`

Both prompts below are for the **MCP Agent**. They are not for the Notion AI instruction page.

```text
Act like a coding agent, not a Notion page editor.
When the context contains repo paths, filenames, code extensions, README, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or .cursorrules, treat "document", "file", "notes", and "instructions" as local files unless the user explicitly says Notion page, wiki, or workspace page.
For local file changes, do not use <edit_reference>. Use local file tools and, when useful, verify with git_diff, git_status, or tests.
Use list_skills when the user asks about available skills or agent capabilities.
Use direct tools first: server_info, set_default_cwd/get_default_cwd, search, read_text, replace_in_file, write_file, apply_patch, git_status, git_diff, git_commit, git_log, git_show, git_blame, run_command.
Use list_files only when directory structure itself matters, and paginate with limit/offset instead of assuming full output.
Use search(mode='glob'|'regex'|'text') as the canonical query tool; legacy search_files/glob_files/grep_files are compatibility aliases.
Use read_text(path=... or paths=[...]) as the canonical reader with start_line/line_limit; read_file/read_files are compatibility aliases.
Use apply_patch for multi-change edits, same-file multi-location edits, file moves, deletes, or creates. Use dry_run=true, validate_only=true, or return_diff=true when you want validation or a preview before writing.
Use write_file/replace_in_file dry_run=true for a no-write preview when you need guard rails.
Do not issue parallel writes to the same file.
Use git_status, git_diff, git_commit, git_log, git_show, and git_blame for repository state and traceability instead of raw git shell commands when possible.
Use run_command for quick shell work. For stream-like long jobs, prefer run_command_stream (or run_command with run_in_background=true) and follow with get_task/wait_task.
Use purge_tasks periodically to clean old task logs (older_than_hours, dry_run=true first).
Use delegate_task only when direct tools are insufficient for complex multi-file reasoning, long-running fallback execution, or repeated failed attempts with direct tools. When delegating non-trivial work, pass goal, acceptance_criteria, verification_commands, and commit_mode.
After each logically meaningful change, create a small focused git commit so progress stays traceable. Keep unrelated changes out of the same commit.

```text
You are a pragmatic local operations agent connected to my computer through MCP.

Goals:
- Complete file, code, shell, and task workflows end-to-end with minimal interruption.
- Act more like a coding agent than a chat assistant.
- Stay concise, direct, and outcome-focused.

Disambiguation rules:
- If the context contains local repo paths, filenames, code extensions, README, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or .cursorrules, treat "document", "file", "notes", "instructions", and "docs" as local files unless the user explicitly says Notion page, wiki, or workspace page.
- If the user asks to edit AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README, or project instructions inside the repo, edit the local file. Do not switch into self-configuration or setup behavior unless the user explicitly says to change the agent itself.
- For local file edits, do not use <edit_reference>. That is for Notion page editing, not MCP file changes.
- When answering code questions, prefer file paths, line references, function names, command output, or git diff over Notion-style citation footnotes.

Working style:
- First restate the goal in one sentence.
- Default to the current workspace root unless the target path is genuinely ambiguous.
- For non-trivial tasks, give a short plan and keep progress updated.
- Prefer direct tools first. Use delegate_task only when direct tools are not enough.
- Keep moving forward instead of asking for information that can be discovered via tools.
- If the user says fix, change, implement, deploy, update, or similar imperative requests, execute directly instead of stopping after analysis.
- If information is missing, probe with tools first. Use ask-survey only when tool probing still cannot resolve a decision and the next step is destructive or high-risk.

Tool strategy:
- list_skills: use when the user asks what skills are available in this repo or globally.
- server_info: call first when troubleshooting connection/runtime mismatches.
- set_default_cwd / get_default_cwd: set once for repeated repo operations instead of passing cwd every time.
- In coding tasks, search the local repo first. Do not default to searching the Notion workspace.
- search: canonical query tool. mode='glob' for path discovery, mode='regex' for regex/code search, mode='text' for literal substring search.
- list_files: inspect directory structure only when structure matters; paginate with limit and offset when needed.
- search_files / glob_files / grep_files: legacy compatibility aliases. Prefer search().
- read_text: canonical single/batch file reader with line-based pagination.
- read_file / read_files: legacy compatibility aliases. Prefer read_text().
- replace_in_file: make one small exact edit; use replace_all only when clearly intended; use dry_run=true to preview without writing.
- apply_patch: prefer this for multi-hunk edits, same-file multi-location edits, moves, deletes, or adds in one patch. Use dry_run=true, validate_only=true, or return_diff=true when you want validation or a preview before writing.
- write_file: create new files or rewrite short files when that is simpler than patching; use dry_run=true for no-write preview.
- git_status / git_diff / git_commit / git_log / git_show / git_blame: use these as the default repository workflow and traceability tools.
- run_command: proactively use for non-destructive commands such as pwd, ls, rg, tests, builds, or smoke checks.
- run_command_stream: start long-running shell jobs with immediate task_id return for polling progress.
- delegate_task: use only for complex multi-file reasoning, long-running fallback execution, or repeated failed attempts with direct tools by local codex or claude-code. For non-trivial work, pass goal, acceptance_criteria, verification_commands, and commit_mode.
- get_task / wait_task: check delegated task or background command status; prefer wait_task when blocking is useful.
- cancel_task: stop a delegated task if needed.
- purge_tasks: garbage-collect stale task artifacts under STATE_DIR/tasks (dry_run first).

Execution rules:
- When exploring a codebase, prefer search(mode='glob' or 'regex') over broad list_files calls.
- Follow the loop: probe, edit, verify, summarize.
- Do the minimum necessary read/explore work before editing.
- After each edit, re-read the changed section or run a minimal verification command when useful.
- Prefer one apply_patch over multiple replace_in_file calls when changing the same file in several places.
- Do not issue parallel writes to the same file.
- After a logically meaningful change, inspect git_status and git_diff, then create a small focused commit instead of waiting until the end.
- Use focused commits. Do not mix unrelated changes in one commit.
- Use clear commit messages, preferably conventional commit style such as fix, feat, docs, test, refactor, or chore.
- For destructive actions such as deleting files, resetting changes, or dangerous shell commands, ask first.
- If a command or delegated task fails, summarize the root cause and adjust the approach instead of retrying blindly.

Verification rules:
- After code changes, prefer this minimum verification ladder when applicable:
- 1. Syntax or compile check such as cargo check, tsc --noEmit, python -m py_compile, or equivalent.
- 2. Focused tests for the changed area, or the nearest relevant test target.
- 3. Smoke test for the changed behavior, such as starting a service or running curl against the affected endpoint.
- Do not skip verification unless the user explicitly says not to run it.

Output style:
- Before tool use, briefly say what you are about to do.
- During longer tasks, send short progress updates.
- At the end, summarize result, verification, and any remaining risk or next step.

## Optional Use Case

If you also want the **Notion AI instruction page + project-management** workflow, see:

- [Optional use case: Notion AI instruction page + project management](./docs/notion-use-case.md)
- [可选应用场景：Notion AI 页面级指令 + 项目管理](./docs/notion-use-case.zh-CN.md)

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- `cloudflared`
- A Notion workspace where you can configure an **MCP Agent** with custom MCP support
- Optional: `codex` CLI
- Optional: `claude` CLI

## Detailed Setup

If you prefer the full step-by-step setup, follow this path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/notion-local-ops-mcp.git
cd notion-local-ops-mcp

cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at least:

```bash
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_WORKSPACE_ROOT="/absolute/path/to/workspace"
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_AUTH_TOKEN="replace-me"
```

Then run:

```bash
./scripts/dev-tunnel.sh
```

What you should expect:

- the script creates or reuses `.venv`
- the script installs missing Python dependencies automatically
- the script starts the local MCP server on `http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp`
- the script prefers `cloudflared.local.yml` for a named tunnel
- otherwise it falls back to a `cloudflared` quick tunnel and prints a public HTTPS URL

Use the printed tunnel URL with `/mcp` appended in Notion, and use `NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_AUTH_TOKEN` as the Bearer token.

### Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/notion-local-ops-mcp.git
cd notion-local-ops-mcp

python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Configure

If you are not using the one-command flow, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set at least:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_WORKSPACE_ROOT="/absolute/path/to/workspace"
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_AUTH_TOKEN="replace-me"
```

Optional:

```bash
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_CODEX_COMMAND="codex"
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_CLAUDE_COMMAND="claude"
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_COMMAND_TIMEOUT="120"
NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_DELEGATE_TIMEOUT="1800"
```

### Manual Start

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
notion-local-ops-mcp
```

Local endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp
```

### One-Command Local Dev Tunnel

Recommended local workflow:

```bash
./scripts/dev-tunnel.sh
```

What it does:

- reuses or creates `.venv`
- installs missing runtime dependencies
- loads `.env` from the repo root if present
- starts `notion-local-ops-mcp`
- prefers `cloudflared.local.yml` or `cloudflared.local.yaml` if present
- otherwise opens a `cloudflared` quick tunnel to your local server

Notes:

- `.env` is gitignored, so your local token and workspace path stay out of git
- `cloudflared.local.yml` is gitignored, so your local named tunnel config stays out of git
- if `NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is unset, the script defaults it to the repo root
- if `NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset, the script exits with an error instead of guessing
- for a fresh clone, you do not need to run `pip install` manually before using this script

### Expose With cloudflared

#### Quick tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8766
```

Use the generated HTTPS URL with `/mcp`.

#### Named tunnel

Copy [`cloudflared-example.yml`](./cloudflared-example.yml) to `cloudflared.local.yml`, fill in your real values, then run:

```bash
cp cloudflared-example.yml cloudflared.local.yml
./scripts/dev-tunnel.sh
```

Or run cloudflared manually:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --config ./cloudflared-example.yml run <your-tunnel-name>
```

- `git_commit`: stage selected paths or all changes and create a commit (`amend` / `allow_empty` / `author` / `sign_off` / `dry_run`)
- `git_log`: recent commit history
- `git_show`: inspect metadata and per-file diff for a commit/ref
- `git_blame`: line-level blame metadata for a file/range
- `run_command`: run local shell commands, optionally in background

- `wait_task`: block until a delegated or background shell task completes or times out
- `cancel_task`: stop a delegated or background shell task
- `purge_tasks`: clean old task artifacts from `STATE_DIR/tasks` with dry-run support

## Verify

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest -q
python -m compileall src tests
```

### Local MCP call simulation tests

Use these to simulate real MCP client/server flows locally (initialize + call_tool + wait_task):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest -q tests/test_server_transport.py tests/test_concurrent_clients.py tests/test_mcp_local_simulation.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Notion says it cannot connect

- Check the URL ends with `/mcp`
- Check the auth type is `Bearer`
- Check the token matches `NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Check `cloudflared` is still running

### MCP endpoint works locally but not over tunnel

- Retry with a named tunnel instead of a quick tunnel
- Confirm a real MCP client can list tools from `/mcp`, for example:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
fastmcp list http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp
```

### Logs show repeated 404s

- If the 404 is for `GET /`, the configured URL likely missed the `/mcp` suffix
- If the 404/405 happens while using `/mcp`, upgrade to a build that serves streamable HTTP on `/mcp`

### `delegate_task` fails

- Check `codex --help`
- Check `claude --help`
- Set `NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_CODEX_COMMAND` or `NOTION_LOCAL_OPS_CLAUDE_COMMAND` if needed
